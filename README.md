vietna.me
=========

Static name matching app.

Finds a Vietnamese name that sounds most similar to the yours.

I wrote this in order to give my daughters and myself Vietnamese nick-names.

It's really quick and dirty.

TODO
----

- gender support
- broader matching (results for e.g. 'Conrad')
- middle name support
- family name support
- IPA support, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA
